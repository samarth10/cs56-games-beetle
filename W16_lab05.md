a) This is a chance based game where the user faces off against the computer or another player, rolling dice in order to build an insect or person.

b) As a player, I can click "Roll" so that the "dice" will roll
As a player, I can see which parts I still need so that I can tell who is in the lead
As a player, I can choose between 'ant', 'beetle', and 'person' so that I can have variety in the game
As a player I can click "Exit" so that I can leave the game at any time
As the GUI, I can display graphics so that the user can interact with the game

c) The software runs. It opens a new window which displays four buttons, which are options of what the user can do. These buttons are used to start the game. After a button is clicked, a new window opens for each prompt.

d) As a user, I want a scoreboard so that I can keep track of the number of wins each palyer has
As a user, I want graphics of the object being built so that I can have a better picture of the progress of the game
As a user, I want a graphic of the dice so that the game feels more interactive
As a user, I want an end game menu so that I can have some options once one game ends

e) Right now, the README.md only contains a short description of what the game does. Things that we can add are instructions of the game, description of different mode options, screenshots of graphics, and a description of the file structure and history.

f) The targets javadoc, test, and download do not have descriptions. We do not see and old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed.

g)The issues currently open for the repo tally to an estimated 1100 points. The issues are pretty clear in terms of their expextations. One issue, 'Add New Levels/Animal' seems to be already completed.

h)Since our code does not have any testcases, an issue we can have is adding testcases. All other seeable issues are covered.

i)The code is organized into various classes. Each Level/Animal has its own GUI along with a StartGUI. There is a class for running the game and for drawing graphics. The class PPlayer is unclear on what it does and there is no documentation on what it does. However, for most of the the classes it was clear what the purpose of each class and its methods are. It is obvious how most of the classes relate to one another. The code is fairly easy to read and understand; there is no confusing or overly complicated code. I would convey to a programmer the startGUI class and the path that it takes from the start to the gameplay screen (Start -> single/multiplayer -> player name -> game screen). I would also show them a Player class and what its methods do.

j) There are no JUnit tests that we see. 'ant test' does not run anything. Therefore, there is great oppurtunity to expand test coverage. We would go about it by adding in tests to check various parts of the game such as if there is a limit on how many games can be played in a row and if the variables for the body parts are holding the right amounts.

Code related stuff:

1. Every class seems to be adequately explained by either normal or javadoc comments.

2. There dooes not seem to be any unecessary/obsolete/confusing portions of the build.xml file.

3. All of the package names correspond to the preferred naming convention for legacy code projects.

4. All attributes and methods are set to public/private/"package private" accordingly.

5. There are no objects that have too much functionality bundled into them.
