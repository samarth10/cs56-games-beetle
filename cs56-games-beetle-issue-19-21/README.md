## Project Description

This is a dice rolling game in which the user can choose between four levels: Beetle, Ant, Person, and Ladybug. 
The game can be played against the computer or against another person.
This game is played by clicking a "Roll" button that randomly rolls a value (1-6) for each play. This value corrensponds to the number on a dice and each number represents a body part of the insect/person trying to be created.
The player must first roll the number representing the "body" or "thorax" before adding on other parts of the insect/person.
The game is won by being the first player to roll all parts of the insect/person.

## File Structure

There is a Run.java file which initially starts the game by opening up the start GUI. Each level has its own GUI class along with a class that tracks each player for that level. There is also DrawComponent and DrawPanel files in order to draw graphics for the game.

## W16 Final Remarks

When the game is run, the startGUI window appears with options for the level. When a level is selected, the corresponding GUI is launched and an instance of a Player object for that level is created. The GUI class for each level contains the code for the buttons and text fields while the Player class contains for for handling the rolls and adding parts.

The main feature that can be improved is improving the graphics. It would be nice for the user to see the animal being built as they play the game.

A couple of bugs that exist is that the exit window pops up right when the game ends, which can cause confusion as to who won the game. Also, after a game ends and the user selects a new level, the window for entering a name reappears. These are further explained in the Issues section ing Github.

As of now, each level has its own Player class. However, these Player classes are very similar to each other. There is possibility to combine them all into one generic class or create a parent class that they inherit from in order to keep the code DRY.
