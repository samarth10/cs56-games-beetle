# Yuanqi L., Samarth G.

1. (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I’m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
 * It's a game played by up to two players. The first player who gets all 6 numbers (each number represents a body part) by rolling dice win.

2. (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
 * Yuanqi's Story: I kept clicking on the button and won the game. That's it. Actually I didn't know what happened.
 * Samarth's Story: As a user, I can only click the "Roll Die" button. I keep clicking this button until someone wins. The user functionality is pretty basic and boring and doesn't require much complexity from the user's side. 

3. (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does.
 * It runs. Basically I just roll dice until I obtain enough numbers to win.

4. (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
 * Yuanqi's Story: It looks funny. Pictures are great. But the game itself is boring. I just click 'roll' and win. I think some more interesting game components can be added, like levels.
 * Samarth's Story: As a user playing against the computer, we were both trying to roll the dice to complete our "human" body first. Both the AI and I had bto get 1 eye left to win, and since it was my turn I clicked the "Roll Dice" button and the game abrubtly ended without showing me who won.

5. (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
 * Without some basic markdown formatting, the current one looks ugly. It should describe source files sorted by directories and indicate what those file do. An instruction on how to compile and run this game is needed.

6. (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the `build.xml` file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
 * The `build.xml` looks good.

7. (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
 * Yes there are enough points. And they are clear.

8. (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
 * The code looks terrible. Identions, code styles, organizations, etc. It need a complete refactor, probably rewrite.

9. (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
 * No. Class names are not clear, organization and structure are a mess. It's hard to understand their code. I would rather say, 
 'Do not try to read it. Just start a new project.'

10. (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
 * It seems they did some basic tests but clearly they do not have corner cases and do not completely test all functionalities of the original program. I would add more tests on game logic and GUIs.
